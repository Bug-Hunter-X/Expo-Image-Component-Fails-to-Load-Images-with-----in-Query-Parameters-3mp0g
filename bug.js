While using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that uses query parameters, the image might not render correctly if the query parameter contains '+' characters.  The '+' characters seem to be misinterpreted by Expo's image loading mechanism, causing the image to fail to load. This is especially tricky because '+' is a valid character in URIs, and standard image loading libraries typically don't have this issue.
